Distributed-denial-of-service-classification
The dataset contains 469478 rows and 9 columns,
the project aim to use both supervised machine learning algorithms and ensemble machine learning algorithms to detect denial of service. 
The target variable is classification which contains [0=  distributed denial of service and 1= normal].
The supervised machine learning model in the project are [support vector machine(svm), logisitic regression (LOG) and KNearest Neighbor(KNN)]
